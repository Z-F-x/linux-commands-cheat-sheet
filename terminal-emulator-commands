# Create an empty file
`touch` `< file_name >`

# Unzip and install `pkg.tar.zst` files
`sudo` `pacman` `-U` `--noconfirm` `your-package.pkg.tar.zst`

# Run a command and let it run in the background (in this example launch waybar and let it run in the background and you can use the terminal for other things):
`waybar` `&` `disown`

        `-c` # Count bytes (or characters, depending on the implementation).

# Set 500 mb limit to `root/var/log/journal` files (useful when you've run out of disk space on root partition and have gotten the error message: "your root partition is running out of disk space, you have 0 mib remaining (0%).":
`sudo` `journalctl` `--vacuum-size=500M`
