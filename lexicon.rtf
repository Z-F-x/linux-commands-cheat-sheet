The file name .bashrc stands for Bash run commands. It is a shell script that is executed automatically by the Bash shell when a new interactive shell session is started. The "rc" in .bashrc stands for "run commands," which is a common convention used for initialization files in Unix-like systems.

Breakdown:
Bash: This refers to the Bourne Again SHell, which is the default shell on many Linux distributions.

What does .zshrc stand for?
.zshrc stands for "Z shell resource configuration."
It is a configuration file for the Z shell (zsh), a popular shell used on Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.
The .zshrc file is used to configure the behavior of the interactive shell (i.e., the shell you interact with in the terminal). It is executed every time a new terminal session is started in interactive mode (when you run zsh in the terminal).
This file can contain environment variables, aliases, functions, customizations (like your prompt), and other settings that you want to apply whenever you use the Z shell.
**************************************************************
The source command is used to reload or execute the contents of a file in the current shell session. When you use source, it allows you to apply changes to configuration files (like .bashrc, .zshrc, or others) without needing to restart the terminal.Why is it called source?
The term "source" comes from the fact that it sources the content of the file into the current shell. In other words, it reads and executes the commands in the file as if they were typed directly into the terminal. The main purpose is to bring in new definitions (variables, functions, etc.) into the active shell session.
